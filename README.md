## Presentation

This repository provide a complete and modern ready to deploy example of a dockerized and distributed app. Deployable using [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) templates or even [Helm](https://helm.sh/) Chart.

### Architecture

![App's architecture scheme](docs/app-architecture.jpg)

## Getting Started

### Run with Docker Compose

1. Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:hbollon/k8s-voting-app-aws.git` (you can alternatively use http)
3. Open a terminal inside the cloned repository folder and build Docker images: `docker-compose build`
4. Start all services: `docker-compose up -d`

The result app should be now accessible through `localhost:9091` and the vote one to `localhost:9090`
To stop all deployed ressources run: `docker-compose down`

### Run with Kubernetes

#### Minikube

Before deploying the app, you must install Minikube and start a cluster:

1. Install [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
2. Start a Minikube cluster: `minikube start`
3. Check that Minikube is fully up (`minikube status`) and kubectl successfully linked (`kubectl get pods -A`)
4. Enable Nginx Ingress Controller addon: `minikube addons enable ingress`

##### Using k8s templates

1. Deploy all k8s ressources: `kubectl apply -f k8s-specifications`
2. Get your cluster IP using: `minikube ip`
3. Enable ingress access:
   - **On Linux:** Edit your hosts file located at `/etc/hosts` by adding `<minikube ip> result.votingapp.com vote.votingapp.com` to the end of it, of course replace `<minikube ip>` by the real cluster ip.
   - **On Windows:** Edit your hosts file located at `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` by adding `127.0.0.1 result.votingapp.com vote.votingapp.com` to the end of it.
   After that, start a Minikube tunnel: `minikube tunnel`

The result app should be now accessible through `result.votingapp.com` and the vote one to `vote.votingapp.com`
To stop and destroy all k8s deployed ressources run: `kubectl delete -f k8s-specifications` and stop minikube using `minikube stop`

##### Using Helm Chart

1. Update Helm repositories and download dependencies: `helm dependency update ./helm/voting-app`
2. Deploy the Helm Chart: `helm template voting-app ./helm/voting-app --namespace=voting-app-stack | kubectl apply -f -`
3. Get your cluster IP using: `minikube ip`
4. Enable ingress access:
   - **On Linux:** Edit your hosts file located at `/etc/hosts` by adding `<minikube ip> result.votingapp.com vote.votingapp.com` to the end of it, of course replace `<minikube ip>` by the real cluster ip.
   - **On Windows:** Edit your hosts file located at `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` by adding `127.0.0.1 result.votingapp.com vote.votingapp.com` to the end of it.
   After that, start a Minikube tunnel: `minikube tunnel`

The result app should be now accessible through `result.votingapp.com` and the vote one to `vote.votingapp.com`
To stop and destroy all k8s deployed ressources run: `helm template voting-app ./helm/voting-app --namespace=voting-app-stack | kubectl delete -f -` and stop minikube using `minikube stop`
